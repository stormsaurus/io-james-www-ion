## Description

Personal website built in Ionic.

Its relatively simplicity makes it a good candidate to periodically rewrite/update using newer technologies in part for learning.  It has been through phases of existance as custom javascript, yui, jquery, angular, and now ionic.

It exercises several components of the ionic framework such as slides/swipper, grids/flex layout, and an assortment of basics like modal, chips, cards, etc.

It's not licensed for privacy reasons but is available to view as a demonstration of work.
