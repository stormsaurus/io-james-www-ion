	<p>For most of my life I have been programming.</p>
	<p>Non-technical experiences are startups and contracting.  I have hired, managed, client interacted, and developed products across a variety of domains.</p>
	<p>Technical experiences are web technologies.  I have architected, managed, mentored, and coded in many different proportions.</p>
	<p>Generally the projects I have worked on were in markets that were moving targets, rapidly changing, and edge technologies.</p>
	<h4>philosophy</h4>
	<ul class="nosymbol">
		<li>simple tools - the problem is often difficult enough already</li>
		<li>transparency - cross team innovation is easier</li>
		<li>avoid surprises - stakeholders on the same page</li>
		<li>open source - contribute back when it makes sense for the business</li>
        <li>push the envelope - great things are made while aiming high</li>
	</ul>

	<p>ES6 feature adoption can not come fast enough. I am tired of javascript framework churn.  I prefer strong variable typing that is compiler inferred unless explicitly declared.  I know the value of closed systems but I inherently don't like them.</p>
